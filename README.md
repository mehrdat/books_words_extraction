# books_words_extraction

This program will help to extract uncommon words from English books and docs for non-English speaker users.

The extractions are from PDF and Epub at the moment. This app will translate those uncommon words and will put them in a list. So if you want to have a look at what words could be in the book that you might need the translation this app will be very helpful.
ATM just translates from English to Persian. But any other languages could be planted in it. 

This app uses TF/IDF and some other methods to get the proper words for translation.
